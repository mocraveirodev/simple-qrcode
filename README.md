# QR Code Generator API Documentation âœ…

Welcome to the QR Code Generator API! This API allows you to create QR codes dynamically by using the Laravel 11 framework. The `/qr-code` endpoint accepts query parameters to customize your QR code based on size and data.

### Query Parameters

-   `size` (required): Integer specifying the size of the QR code in pixels. Must be between 10 and 1000.
-   `data` (required): String containing the data to be encoded into the QR code. This can be plain text or structured data with special prefixes for different functionalities as described below.

### Special Data Prefixes

Depending on the prefix of the `data` parameter, the QR code will represent different types of information:

## Getting Started

1.  **Base URL**: Ensure you know the base URL where the API is hosted. The endpoint mentioned above will be appended to this base URL.
    
2.  **Query Parameters**: Include `size` and `data` parameters in your request according to the requirements stated above.
    
3.  **Error Handling**: The API is designed to communicate specific issues in the request parameters with clear error messages, helping clients to quickly diagnose and fix issues in their API requests. Below are the common error messages that you might encounter:

-   **size.required:** 'A size is required'
    
    -   This error occurs when the `size` parameter is not included in the request. Ensure that you specify a size value when you make a request.
-   **size.integer:** 'A size has to be a number'
    
    -   This error indicates that the `size` parameter is not a valid integer. Please ensure that you provide a numerical value for size.
-   **size.min:** 'A minimum size is 10'
    
    -   This message is returned when the value specified in the `size` parameter is less than the minimum allowed size of 10 pixels. Adjust your request to meet this minimum size requirement.
-   **size.max:** 'A maximum size is 1000'
    
    -   This error is displayed when the `size` parameter exceeds the maximum limit of 1000 pixels. Ensure that your size value does not surpass this limit.
-   **data.required:** 'A data is required'
    
    -   This error occurs when the `data` parameter is missing in the request. The `data` parameter is essential for generating the QR code, so make sure to include it.
